<h1>IronMan to Rescue</h1>

**I am a huge marvel fan and when I started to learn pygame I wanted to make a project related to that.**

<h2>Background</h2>

The game is a basic single-player game in which you need to avoid obstacles similar to the helicopter game we used to play but here is the twist â€“ you don&#39;t only need to avoid obstacles like building but also fireballs! And you even get to choose your favorite character to play with

I even added a SQL database to save scores so you can compete with friends or yourself!

<h2>How to play</h2>

Just download the repository and go in game\_ironman

And run the menu.py

Enter your name and press start!

Choose your player!

Start playing!

And when the game is over

See high scores and see where you stand! And then try again to beat that highest score!

<h2>How I made it</h2>

I used pygame for GUI and sqlite3 for backend

I need to use a lot of collision detection and physics to make player and objects moves, and to reduce points and life

I followed modularity and abstraction by dividing my project into small parts which made it easier to code and debug


<h5> I have added screenshots of game in README.pdf</h5>
